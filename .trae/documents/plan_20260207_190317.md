I will replace the client-side "Blue Box" (Face-api.js) with a backend-driven "Green Box" to match your local system's look and feel exactly.

### **Phase 1: Backend Updates (`app.py`)**

1. **Modify** **`process_attendance_frame`:**

   * **Goal:** Return bounding box coordinates and recognition tags to the frontend.

   * **Change:** Update the JSON response to include:

     * `box`: `[x, y, w, h]` (The coordinates of the detected face).

     * `tag`: The text to display (e.g., "22/10799" or "Unknown").

     * `status`: Current status (`marked`, `already_marked`, `no_match`).
2. **Modify** **`save_capture`** **(Registration):**

   * **Goal:** Allow the registration page to show the green box during capture.

   * **Change:** Update JSON response to include `box` coordinates of the detected face, even if it's just a detection check.

### **Phase 2: Frontend Updates**

1. **`student_attendance.html`** **(Attendance Page):**

   * **Remove:** Delete all `face-api.js` scripts and the "Blue Box" logic.

   * **Add:** Implement a custom Canvas drawer that takes the `box` and `tag` from the backend response and draws:

     * A **Green Rectangle** (2px thickness).

     * **Green Text** above the box showing the Matric Number (or "Unknown").
2. **`capture.html`** **(Registration Page):**

   * **Remove:** Delete
